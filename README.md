Music Symbols Icons
===================

This webfont is based on Robert Allgeyer's [MusicQwik](http://www.fontspace.com/robert-allgeyer/musiqwik).    
It has been transformed on an SVG font using [Font2Web](http://www.font2web.com).    
Finally the web-icon version has been generated with [Fontello](http://fontello.com), **an über-cool open source project**.

Intent
------

The intention of this icon web font is to serve as notation source for an Angular 
Directive part of the [Triángulo Project](https://github.com/fmquaglia/triangulo).
